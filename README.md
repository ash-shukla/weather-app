**Weather App**

--- This Weather app is built on top of React.js Along with Ant Design as a UI Library ---

--- For State management React's inbuilt Context API has been used ---

--- For Theme system Ant Design's default theme algorithm is used ---

**I have used yarn package bundling**

a:So if you don't have yarn make sure to run the command:
**npm install -g yarn**
this install yarn in your machine globally

--- Now run the command **yarn install**

    yarn install

--- Once the dependencies are installed run **yarn dev** this starts the server

    yarn dev

--- I have updated the **vite.config.js** with **port:5000** and **open:true** that loads the

    project automatically(by default vite's port is 5173 and open is false)

--- Once the project loads you can the **Weather App**
